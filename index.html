                <h1 class="mainHeading">TWENTY ONE PILOTS</h1>
                      <p> Twenty One Pilots is my favourite band because their help me through get through the hardest and rough times in my life they have this cool vibe that when i listen to them when life gets hard it always seems to me that they are telling me "WHEN LIFE GETS TOUGH THE TOUGHER GETS GOING". Personally I listen to them because they have always been a part of my life since their songs some times feel like they are talking about most teenagers lives. Twenty One Pilots are super popular, but they’re an unspoken element in the world. Most people don't talk about them,even as they quietly sing the chorus to the top’s most popular song “Stressed Out” a Grammy award wining song.</p>
