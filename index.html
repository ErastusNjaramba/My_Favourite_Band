        <h1>Who are the 21 PILOTS</h1>
        <p class="pilots" style="font-size: 15px;">Twenty One Pilots is an American Band from Columbus, Ohio. The band was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along 
        with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih. The Band is best known for the singles "Stressed Out", "Ride", and "Heathens".
        The group received a Grammy Award for Best Band Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for "Stressed Out". 
        The band independently released two albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by
        record label Fueled by Ramen in 2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013 and became the second album in history on which every 
        track received at least a gold certification, making Twenty One Pilots the first band in the history of music to see every song on 
        two albums earn gold or platinum awards.</p>
